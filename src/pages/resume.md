### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

To work with a progressive, technology-driven organization where I can be challenged while developing applications and user experiences that apply my passion for Javascript, CSS, and HTML5 .

### CORE STRENGTHS

I implement designs using elegant, clean and efficient code. I am highly focused, productive and deadline driven. I am an effective debugger and thorough browser tester. I follow specs accurately and communicate across teams fluidly to get work done. I have an obsessive desire to find solutions to problems. I'm not "set in my ways" — I always want to learn new and better ways of doing things. Everyone likes to work with me because I'm reliable and easy to get along with.
