  I'm a full stack web developer with 13 years of professional web development
  experience.


  People are always happy with my results and say I'm awesome to work with,
  highly productive and very reliable.


  When I'm not coding I enjoy riding my bike, slack-lining, cooking, and making
  kombucha.
